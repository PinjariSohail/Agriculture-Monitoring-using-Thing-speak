# Agriculture-Monitoring-using-Thing-speak

This project is an IoT-based Agriculture Field Monitoring System designed to assist farmers in remotely tracking vital environmental parameters like soil moisture and sunlight intensity to ensure optimal growth conditions for crops. By leveraging the capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller, which features built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, we are able to transmit real-time sensor data to the ThingSpeak cloud platform. The system uses a Soil Moisture Sensor to measure the water content present in the soil and an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor to detect the amount of ambient sunlight available to the crops. These sensors are connected to the ESP32, which periodically reads the data and pushes it to the cloud, enabling farmers to monitor the condition of their fields from anywhere using a simple internet dashboard.

The main advantage of this system lies in its remote monitoring capabilities and data visualization. With the help of ThingSpeak, farmers can observe graphical trends of soil moisture and light levels over time, helping them make data-driven decisions regarding irrigation and crop management. This eliminates the need for manual inspection of fields and reduces water usage by ensuring irrigation is done only when necessary. This system is particularly beneficial in areas where resource optimization is critical or where the field is located at a distance. The project can be further expanded by integrating temperature, humidity sensors, or even automated irrigation controls for a more comprehensive smart agriculture solution.
